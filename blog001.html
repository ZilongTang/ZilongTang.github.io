              <h4><strong>Project innovation point</strong></h4>
              <li><strong>Innovation in material combination</strong>:</li>
              <p>The steel and wood structural floor slab we designed partially compensates for the strength problem of wood, while also constraining excessive deformation of the wood. The good ductility and plasticity of the steel make it more reliable to combine with the wood, while the instability of the wide and thick wood to a certain extent compensates for the thermal conductivity of the steel. The excellent thermal insulation can also partially compensate for the brittleness of the steel at low temperatures.</p>
              <li><strong>Innovation in combination structure</strong>:</li>
              <p>The steel wood structure floor we designed will make full use of the Strength of materials performance. The section steel is used for the lower side tension, and the wood is used for the upper side compression, and the neutral axis is located at the junction of the two materials as far as possible; The connection between steel and wood adopts self tapping and self drilling screws instead of adhesive bonding, making the connection and coordination of the two materials more reliable and able to maintain a certain strength even after reaching the maximum load.</p>

        	<li><strong>Innovation in structural system</strong>:</li>
              <p>It reduces the waste of building materials during construction, saves resources, greatly reduces the generation of Construction waste, and is more environmentally friendly. Steel, as a recyclable material, is more low-carbon and environmentally friendly in production compared to cement. As a renewable green resource, wood production is environmentally friendly. Trees have functions such as absorbing carbon dioxide, purifying air, and maintaining soil and water during their growth, resulting in a short production cycle. Moreover, wood production causes less environmental damage and consumes much less energy than other materials. Steel is recyclable material, while wood is degradable, so this kind of floor will not produce Construction waste when recycled.</p>
          <li><strong>Meet diverse needs</strong>:</li>
              <p>For the designer, this type of floor slab has a relatively light weight and can be used in high-rise buildings or some lightweight buildings that require a smaller weight bearing structure; No maintenance required, with good adaptability to various common climatic conditions; The components can be mass-produced on a large scale, with more guaranteed quality, less quality fluctuation, uniform structural texture, and strong predictability during design; The height is relatively small and the cost is relatively cheap.
              <br>For the construction party, this type of floor slab can be prefabricated and installed conveniently, reducing a considerable part of the process, greatly shortening the construction period, eliminating the problems of setting time and early strength, and also saving the use of templates; Less affected by weather, no need to consider maintenance conditions such as temperature and humidity; Immediately after installation, the construction of the next floor can proceed; The noise and dust have been reduced, and the number of on-site construction and management personnel can also be reduced.
              <br>For users, this type of floor has strong toughness, light weight, and better shock absorption effect than general assembly components. The upper layer of the decorative surface can be treated slightly as a wooden floor without the need for laying floor tiles; Good durability and significant stability; Excellent insulation effect and stronger living comfort.</p>
 
        	
        	
        	<h4><strong>Feelings</strong></h4>
        	<p>In this project, I have consolidated my professional knowledge, fully exercised my logical thinking ability, innovation awareness, and hands-on ability. </p>
        	
              <li><strong>Material market research</strong>:</li>
              <p>Understood the vast market for civil engineering materials, with a wide variety and diverse forms, and a mature industrial chain. Through communication with personnel in the market, we recognize the widespread market demand for basic materials such as steel, wood, and concrete. At the same time, comparing the goods with other companies, we also saw market chaos such as uneven quality of materials, lack of supervision over material transportation and management. Recognized the indispensable and important position of civil engineering as a livelihood project in society, and also recognized that the development and standardization of materials play an extremely important role in civil engineering.</p>
              <li><strong>Experimental Design and Preparation</strong>:</li>
              <p>We gradually explore and try various construction modes, and spend a lot of time making our formed components. It is necessary to combine theory with practice to understand the cognitive mode of practice. We cannot limit ourselves to the knowledge in textbooks and break away from practice, especially for our engineering subjects. </p>
              <li><strong>Teamwork</strong>:</li>
              <p>It is very meaningful to form a united, strong and powerful team through effective organizational forms. As the project leader, it is important to coordinate the time of team members and fully utilize their talents. </p>
          <h4><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></h4>
        	<p>Sincere thanks to Prof. Weijian Yi for his meticulous guidance throughout the entire process, to the seniors and sisters for their help, and to the team members for their work. </p>
